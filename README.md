# Project: Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office


**Python projects on DataCamp**

*Apply the foundational skills in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses to manipulate and visualize movie and TV data.*


## Description

In this project, you’ll apply the skills you learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. You’ll press “watch next episode” to discover if Netflix’s movies are getting shorter over time and which guest stars appear in the most popular episode of "The Office", using everything from lists and loops to pandas and matplotlib.

You’ll also gain experience in an essential data science skill — exploratory data analysis. This will allow you to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots you create of the data. Press play to begin!
